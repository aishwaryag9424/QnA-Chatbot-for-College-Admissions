# QnA-Chatbot-for-College-Admissions

In this project I have created a chatbot that could help with answering admission related QnA. This chatbot is built using Google Palm LLM model and Langchain framework.

## What is Langchain?

LangChain is an open-source framework that simplifies the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides tools and integrations to connect LLMs with external data sources and other components, allowing developers to build more sophisticated and context-aware AI applications. 

## What is LLM?

Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that excels at understanding, processing, and generating human language. LLMs are trained on massive datasets, allowing them to learn patterns and structures in language, making them useful for various tasks like question answering, content creation, and translation.
